__Divided Development and the Struggle for Housing Justice in LA__ uses archival materials from the UCLA Library’s digital collections to illustrate the richness of Los Angeles communities formed, contested, and reshaped amid discriminatory citywide development campaigns. Contextual essays are combined with photographs, contemporary print ephemera, local musical recordings, and relevant oral history recordings held by UCLA to tell the stories of the Aréchiga family in the Palo Verde neighborhood of the Chavez Ravine and the Laws family in Watts.
