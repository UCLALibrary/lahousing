# UCLA Digital Library Collection Enhancement Project

###### **By: Joaquin Peres, Julia Tanenbaum, Syann Lunsford, Rachel Abrahams, Katherine Ramirez, and Jake Tompkins**


This project uses archival materials from the UCLA Library’s digital collections to illustrate the richness of Los Angeles communities and their development campaigns suffused with racial discrimination and how they were forced to move and evolve over time through the stories of the Aréchiga family in the Palo Verde neighborhood of the Chavez Ravine and the Laws family in Watts.
