We are a group of Library and Information Studies Master’s students at UCLA that work as assistants for the Digital Library Program (DLP). While the UCLA Library Digital Collections include rare & unique digital materials to support education, research, service, and creative expression, this digital exhibit is specifically meant to coalesce materials related to housing injustice in Los Angeles across multiple collections. These collections currently include the Los Angeles Times Photograph, Miriam Matthews Photograph, Maps of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Daily News, and Alfred Thomas Quinn collections. Our hope for this exhibit is to draw out the stories of the Laws and Aréchiga families⁠—experiences that were in some ways ‘hidden’ within the DLP’s collections⁠—to encourage more people to learn about the history of housing injustices in Los Angeles.   

In the process of selecting materials for this exhibit, we have also considered ways that the descriptive metadata for these items can be altered or updated on the [DLP website](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/) to improve the accessibility of these materials for patrons interested in researching zoning, redlining, evictions, and other tools used to segregate housing and the urban landscape throughout the history of Los Angeles.
