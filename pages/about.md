Henry and Texanna Laws moved into a property near Watts, on the white side of the de facto racial divider of 92nd street, in October 1944. The property’s deed included a racially restrictive covenant, which their white neighbors enforced by suing the Laws. With the help of the NAACP, the Laws resisted the covenant in the courts in a legal battle they initially lost despite steadfast insistence on staying in their home. In 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shelley vs. Kraemer that covenants were illegal, and the covenant governing the Laws’ property was overturned. 

Perhaps the most infamous displacement of communities of color in Los Angeles history occurred in the Latino neighborhoods of Palo Verde, Bishop, and La Loma in the Chavez Ravine. The Battle of Chavez Ravine, a decade-long campaign by city officials and developers to uproot the area's residents in the service of redevelopment, began in earnest in 1950 but lasted through 1959. In July of 1950, the LA Sheriffs delivered eviction notices to the three communities, declaring their location the future site of a public housing development (designed by Richard Neutra) called 'Elysian Park Heights'. The Los Angeles City Housing Authority (CHA) expelled almost 3,800 residents of the neighborhoods, which they designated as “blighted”, throughout the 1950s.[^1] Developers' cash offers and the FHA’s use of eminent domain removed many of the Ravine's families before a first wave of demolitions in 1952, but some resisted the increasing pressure. The city broke its promises of a fair price and public housing in exchange for the residents’ lost homes after the election of anti-communist mayor Norris Poulson in 1953. 
Instead, in 1958, they sold the land to Walter O’Malley to lure his Dodgers baseball team to LA with a new stadium.[^2] As residents who created the archival preservation and oral history project Chavez Ravine: An Unfinished Story wrote, “The massive transformation of Palo Verde, Bishop and La Loma over the course of the 1950s represents one of the most egregious examples of racist urban renewal practices and the displacement of communities of color.”[^3]

Some families refused to move and resisted displacement particularly in the last phase of evictions in May 1959. Iconic images of the Aréchiga family resisting forcible eviction galvanized public support for the community in the face of intractable political commitment to the stadium. Abrana and Manuel Aréchiga lived at 1771 Malvina Avenue in Palo Verde for over 40 years and stayed in the neighborhood despite nine years of eviction orders, sheriff’s deputies, and threats. In April 1959, councilman Ed Roybal intervened to prompt a settlement between the family and the city. Nevertheless, the Aréchiga family hoped to take their case to the Supreme Court, who refused to hear it.[^4] The family protested their displacement even after their home was destroyed, and they maintained a vigil outside of their tent until their forced removal by Sheriff's deputies. Images of war widow Aurora Vargas struggling against LA Sheriffs as they evicted her by force on May 8th, 1959 moved the public and long afterwards. Ground was broken on Dodger Stadium that September, and the finished park saw its first game in 1962.
