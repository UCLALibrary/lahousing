We are a group of Library and Information Studies Master’s students at UCLA working in the Digital Library Program (DLP). While the [UCLA Library Digital Collections](http://digital.library.ucla.edu) include rare & unique digital materials to support education, research, service, and creative expression, this digital exhibit intends to highlight materials related to housing injustice in Los Angeles across multiple collections. This exhibit documents the stories of the Laws and Aréchiga families⁠—experiences that were in some ways ‘hidden’ within the Digital Collections⁠—to encourage more people to learn about the history of housing injustices in Los Angeles.<br />

 The selected resources are drawn primarily from collections published through the UCLA Library Digital Collections website: the [Los Angeles Times Photographs Collection](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/z7pn2000zz-89112); [Miriam Matthews Photograph Collection](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/dnf8141z-89112); [Maps of Los Angeles, California, United States and the World](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/z84h2000zz-89112); [Pamphlet Maps Collection](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/wvf0d100zz-89112); [Los Angeles Daily News Negatives](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/8zn49200zz-89112); and the [Alfred Thomas Quinn Collection](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/bvt38c1z-89112). Some of the resources originate from other UCLA-affiliated collections, such as UCLA Library Special Collections’ [Richard and Dion Neutra Papers](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7d5nb4js/) and [Edward R. Roybal Papers](https://calisphere.org/collections/18788/), both published via [Calisphere](https://calisphere.org/); the UCLA Center for Oral History Research’s [Black Leadership in Los Angeles](https://oralhistory.library.ucla.edu/?f%5Bseries_facet%5D%5B%5D=Black+Leadership+in+Los+Angeles) series; and the [Strachwitz Frontera Collection of Mexican and Mexican American Recordings](http://frontera.library.ucla.edu/).<br />

In the process of selecting materials for this exhibit we have also considered ways that the descriptive metadata for these items can be enhanced or remediated on the Digital Collections website to improve the discoverability of these materials for patrons interested in researching zoning, redlining, evictions, and other methods used to segregate housing and the urban landscape throughout the history of Los Angeles.<br />
